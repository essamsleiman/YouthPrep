# YouthPrep

YouthPrep is an app to streamline the private tutoring business. It will look at points of conflict and tedious work that arise in private tutoring and automate them! 

Some features:

  A calendar will make the process of schedule matching between tutors and clients less chaotic. Not only will this make recurring sessions easier, but it opens up the possibility of tutoring on demand
  
  Payment accountability and logs are through the app. (of course using secure databases and login systems, with actual money transfer through paypal or cash)
  
  Even better, the tutor will take notes on each session that the parents will see- so they know exactly what they paid for 
  
  Tutor profiles so the parent knows exactly how experienced and knowledgeable the person working with their child is
  
  [and many more features are in the works!] 


We will add value and convenince to tutoring through this app, and scale our own network of tutors by launching on several college campuses nationwide this fall.
